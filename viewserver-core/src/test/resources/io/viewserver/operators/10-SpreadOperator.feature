Feature: Spread operator fixture

  Background:
	Given table named "source" with data
	  | id~Int | market~String | product~String    |
	  | 0      | Market1       | Product1,Product2 |
	  | 1      | Market1       | Product2          |
	  | 2      | Market1       | Product3,Product3 |
	  | 3      | Market1       | Product1          |

	When operator type "spread" named "spread1" created
	  | field             | value   |
	  | inputColumn       | product |
	  | outputColumn      | spread  |
	  | spreadFunction    | csv     |
	  | removeInputColumn | false   |
	And operator "source" output "out" plugged into "spread1" input "in"
	And listen for changes on "spread1" output "out"
	And commit

  Scenario: Can spread CSV column
	When operator type "spread" named "spread2" created
	  | field             | value   |
	  | inputColumn       | product |
	  | outputColumn      | spread  |
	  | spreadFunction    | csv     |
	  | removeInputColumn | false   |
	And operator "source" output "out" plugged into "spread2" input "in"
	And listen for changes on "spread2" output "out"
	And commit
	Then operator "spread2" output "out" is
	  | ~Action     | ~Name   | ~ColumnType | ~TEId | id | market  | spread   |
	  | SchemaReset |         |             |       |    |         |          |
	  | ColumnAdd   | id      | Int         | 0     |    |         |          |
	  | ColumnAdd   | market  | String      | 1     |    |         |          |
	  | ColumnAdd   | spread  | String      | 2     |    |         |          |
	  | ColumnAdd   | product | String      | 3     |    |         |          |
	  | DataReset   |         |             |       |    |         |          |
	  | RowAdd      |         |             | 0     | 0  | Market1 | Product1 |
	  | RowAdd      |         |             | 0     | 0  | Market1 | Product2 |
	  | RowAdd      |         |             | 1     | 1  | Market1 | Product2 |
	  | RowAdd      |         |             | 2     | 2  | Market1 | Product3 |
	  | RowAdd      |         |             | 3     | 2  | Market1 | Product3 |
	  | RowAdd      |         |             | 4     | 3  | Market1 | Product1 |
	And commit


  Scenario: Updated row is correctly reflected in spread operator
	When operator type "spread" named "spread2" created
	  | field             | value   |
	  | inputColumn       | product |
	  | outputColumn      | spread  |
	  | spreadFunction    | csv     |
	  | removeInputColumn | false   |
	And operator "source" output "out" plugged into "spread2" input "in"
	And listen for changes on "spread2" output "out"
	And commit
	Then operator "spread2" output "out" is

	  | RowAdd      |         |             | 4     | 3  | Market1 | Product1 |
	And commit
	When table "source" updated to
	  | id~Int | product~String |
	  | 2      |                |
