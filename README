Importing into intellij

There are a number of .java files that are excluded from the project they will have _KeyName_ in their path. When importing the project into intellij from maven the .idea/compiler.xml file in which these exclusions are saved is overwritten. In order to re excluded go into the .idea directory then revert modifications to the file to what is stored in git. Then close and re-open project
